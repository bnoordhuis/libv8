libv8-3.14 (3.14.5.8-9) unstable; urgency=medium

 The high rate of vulnerabilities and partial lack of upstream support in the
 form of long term branches make it very difficult to support libv8 with
 backported security fixes.
 Additionally, library interdependencies make it impossible to update to
 newer upstream releases.
 Therefore, packages built upon libv8 are included in Jessie, but not covered
 by security support.
 These packages should not be used in production environments.
